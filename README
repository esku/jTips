Welcome to jTips

Here you will find all the source code for the jTips component and 
all modules and plugins.

Why?

jTips started in 2005 with Joomla! 1.0 and has grown and evolved based on 
numerous requests and feedback on functionality.

It has reach the point now where as much as I would love to continue developing
and supporting the project, there simply just are not enough hours in the day.

And so jTips is now publicly available for download!
